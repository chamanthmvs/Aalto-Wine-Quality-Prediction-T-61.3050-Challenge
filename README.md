# Aalto-Wine-Quality-Prediction-T-61.3050-Challenge
It is one of the challenges in kaggle

Jorma, Alex and the T.A's need your help selecting the perfect bottle of wine for that special occasion. Since we don't know much about wine itself, we're hoping that training data with expert ratings will help us decide what makes a 'good' wine good. Use the training data to predict the quality of unrated wines in the test data.
